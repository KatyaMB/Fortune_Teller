# A JavaScript Fortune Teller
JavaScript

In my first JavaScript Project I created a fortune teller that will calculate when you will meet your best friend,
and the best friend's name. It also calculates the number of years in which you will get married, how many children 
you will have and in how many years you will have to start dying your hair. 

The output is a multiline string that uses template literals to output the result to the console,
all from prompt entries and the user's own information inputs.

Happy fortunes to you!
